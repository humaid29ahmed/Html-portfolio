<h1>The Best Movies According to Humaid</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pursuit of Happiness</h3>
<p>It is a movie, which shows the beautiful bond between a father who is working hard for the better future of his son and a son who love his father so much that he adjust himself into different situation that his father is everytime whether be it a good or bad situation. This movie is even inspirational where it shows that if we work hard we can achieve anything in life . </p>
<h3>October Sky</h3>
<p>It is an inspiring movie where a boy who is a son of a coal miner who wants to build a rocket even after continuous resistance by his father who believes that their community life begins and ends with coal mining and they have no better future beyond their community profession. </p>
<h3>Evil Dead</h3>
<p>It is a horror movie where a bunch of teenager go to a forest and end up unleashing a demon through a book that was in the abandoned house in the forest and the demons end up taking lives of all the teenager accept one who somehow fought the demon and save her life. To be honest I found this movie characters dumb because even after clear instruction given in the book the guy didn't stop reading and end up unleashing a demons but still it is one of my favourite movie because I love those horror movies which contains demons rather than some revengeful souls who wants to take someone life.</p>
